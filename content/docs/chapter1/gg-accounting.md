Greenhouse gas accounting is the process by which organizations quantify their greenhouse gas emissions. However, this field is not nearly as developed as financial accounting and the world is currently deprived of detailed and up-to-date data on greenhouse gas emissions. The World Development Indicators have recently adopted CAIT as a source for country-level greenhouse gas emissions data by year with the purpose of making data on greenhouse gas emissions easily available and familiarize users with how greenhouse gas emissions are measured. Measurements indicate that China, the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, is the only country that has passed the 10 gigaton (Gt) threshold of yearly emissions of CO2 equivalent (CO2e), but how much exactly is a gigaton of carbon dioxide equivalent? How can emissions be aggregated? How can we become carbon accountants and oversee the measurement of greenhouse gas emissions around the world?

Greenhouse gases are gases that trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere, which means they let sunlight pass through the atmosphere, but they prevent the heat that the sunlight brings from leaving the atmosphere. The main gases responsible for the greenhouse effect include carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and water vapor (which occur naturally), and fluorinated gases or chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) (which are synthetic). Greenhouse gases occur naturally in the Earth’s atmosphere, which is a good thing. Otherwise, the Earth would be too cold to sustain life. However, human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, are increasing the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, causing global warming and climate change. The combustion of fossil fuels for electricity and heat production comprises the single largest contributor to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions accounting for nearly a quarter of all emissions. Other major sources of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions include transportation, industry, and agriculture. Land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF) is both a source and sink of emissions.

## Global Warming Potential (GWP)

Different greenhouse gases last in the atmosphere for different lengths of time, and they also absorb different amounts of heat. Two ways in which greenhouse gases differ from each other are their ability to absorb energy and how long they stay in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) is a term for describing different greenhouse gases in a common unit. That way, a carbon footprint consisting of lots of different greenhouse gases can be expressed as a single number. The global warming potential (GWP) of a greenhouse gas indicates the amount of warming a gas causes over a given period (normally 100 years), relative to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). Methane scores 25 (meaning that one ton of methane will cause the same amount of warming as 25 tons of CO2), nitrous oxide comes in at 298 and some of the super-potent F-gases score more than 10,000.

## Emissions by country

About 60% of GHG emissions come from just 10 countries, while the 100 least-emitting contribute less than 3%. In 2018, China released 9.66 gigatons or billion metric tons of CO2. But if you include its emissions of methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases, the country's total emissions add up to 11.71 gigatons of CO2e. In other words, those extra gases added the equivalent of 2.05 extra gigatons of CO2. That is approximately 24% or one fourth of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions. The primary source of CO2 emissions in China is fossil fuels, notably coal burning. About 58% of the total energy derived in China came from coal alone in 2019, and since coal is rich in carbon, burning it in China's power and industrial plants and boilers releases large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere.
