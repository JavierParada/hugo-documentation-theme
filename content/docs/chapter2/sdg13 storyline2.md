The world isn't cutting greenhouse gas emissions with anything like the speed required to avoid the most dangerous effects of climate change. The international goal to limit global heating to 1.5° Celsius is officially on life support. A United Nations-backed panel of climate scientists has warned that the world may be on track to warm by more than 3°C — twice the Paris Agreement target —in a change that would painfully remake societies and life on the planet. 

Time to limit warming is perilously short. Greenhouse gas pollution must peak “at the latest before 2025” to keep targets alive, the IPCC scientists write. Based on national pledges made before last November’s Glasgow climate negotiations, emissions in 2030 “would make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century".

## How did we get to 417 ppm?

Carbon dioxide levels in the air are at their highest in 650,000 years. Since 1850, CO2 concentrations have risen from 280 ppm (parts-per-million) to 417 ppm as of March 2022. During the same time period, global mean temperature increased approximately 1 degree Celsius above the pre-industrial baseline. In other words, the additional 137 ppm (417 - 280) of CO2 into the Earth's atmosphere has increased global temperature by around 1°C.

CO2 has increased dramatically since the Industrial Revolution compared to paleoclimatologic (past climate) measurements over the past 800,000 years (based on the comparison of atmospheric samples contained in ancient ice cores and more recent direct measurements).

## Historical emissions

Total net anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise during the period 2010–2019. Average annual greenhouse gas emissions during 2010-2019 were higher than in any previous decade.
