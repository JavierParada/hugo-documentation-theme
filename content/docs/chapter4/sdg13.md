# Greenhouse gas accounting

Greenhouse gas accounting is the process by which organizations quantify their greenhouse gas emissions. However, this field is not nearly as developed as financial accounting and the world is currently deprived of detailed and up-to-date data on greenhouse gas emissions. The World Development Indicators have recently adopted the World Resources Institute’s Climate Analysis Indicators Tool ([CAIT](https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ghg-emissions)) as a source for country-level greenhouse gas emissions data by year with the purpose of making data on greenhouse gas emissions easily available[^1] and familiarize users with how greenhouse gas emissions are measured. Measurements indicate that China, the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, is the only country that has passed the 10 gigaton (Gt) threshold of yearly emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent (CO2e), but how much exactly is a gigaton of carbon dioxide equivalent? How can emissions be aggregated? How can we become carbon accountants and oversee the measurement of greenhouse gas emissions around the world?

## Introduction

Greenhouse gases are gases that trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere, which means they let sunlight pass through the atmosphere, but they prevent the heat that the sunlight brings from leaving the atmosphere. The main gases responsible for the greenhouse effect include carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and water vapor (which occur naturally), and fluorinated gases or chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) (which are synthetic). Greenhouse gases occur naturally in the Earth’s atmosphere, which is a good thing. Otherwise, the Earth would be too cold to sustain life. However, human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, are increasing the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, causing global warming and climate change. The combustion of fossil fuels for electricity and heat production comprises the single largest contributor to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions accounting for nearly a quarter of all emissions. Other major sources of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions include transportation, industry, and agriculture. Land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF) is both a source and sink of emissions.

## Global Warming Potential (GWP)

Different greenhouse gases last in the atmosphere for different lengths of time, and they also absorb different amounts of heat. Two ways in which greenhouse gases differ from each other are their ability to absorb energy and how long they stay in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) is a term for describing different greenhouse gases in a common unit. That way, a carbon footprint consisting of lots of different greenhouse gases can be expressed as a single number. The global warming potential (GWP) of a greenhouse gas indicates the amount of warming a gas causes over a given period (normally 100 years), relative to the emissions of 1 ton of CO<sub>2</sub>. Methane scores 25 (meaning that one ton of methane will cause the same amount of warming as 25 tons of CO<sub>2</sub>), nitrous oxide comes in at 298 and some of the super-potent F-gases score more than 10,000.[^2]

## Emissions by Country

About 60&#37; of GHG emissions come from just 10 countries, while the 100 least-emitting contribute less than 3%. In 2018, China released 10.31 gigatons or billion metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub>. But if you include its emissions of methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases, the country's total emissions add up to 12.36 gigatons of CO2e. In other words, those extra gases added the equivalent of 2.05 extra gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub>. That is approximately 24% or one fourth of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions. The primary source of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in China is fossil fuels, notably coal burning. About 58% of the total energy derived in China came from coal alone in 2019, and since coal is rich in carbon, burning it in China's power and industrial plants and boilers releases large amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere.

## Flows by Sectors and Gases

At current greenhouse gas emission rates, temperatures could increase by 2 °C (3.6 °F), which the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says is the upper limit to avoid "dangerous" levels, by 2050. The vast majority of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions come from combustion of fossil fuels, principally coal, petroleum (including oil) and natural gas, with additional contributions from deforestation and other changes in land use.

### Carbon dioxide

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the primary greenhouse gas emitted through human activities. Burning fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas is the leading cause of increased anthropogenic CO2. Deforestation is the second major cause. 

In 2018, X gigatonnes of carbon were released from fossil fuels. 

### Methane

Methane is the second-most prevalent greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide but much more potent in the short term in its ability to heat the planet. It is the main component of natural gas and is also released into the atmosphere from landfills, livestock and thawing permafrost. One study reported that the livestock sector in general (primarily cattle, chickens, and pigs) produces 37% of all human-induced methane. Methane has a more powerful warming effect than carbon dioxide over the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere. Even though CO<sub>2</sub> has a longer-lasting effect, cutting methane emissions is the fastest opportunity we have to immediately slow the rate of global warming. 

### Nitrous Oxide

The third most important long-lived greenhouse gas is nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide gets much less attention than carbon dioxide and methane, but it is 300 times more powerful at warming the planet than carbon dioxide. Nitrous oxide, more commonly known as "laughing gas", is a potent greenhouse gas that substantially contributes to global warming. Global emissions of N2O are increasing as a result of human activities that stimulate its production. At present, human agricultural practices account for over two-thirds of global N2O emissions. 

The biggest culprit: the increase in agricultural lands and synthetic fertilizer use in agriculture, which has steadily increased in recent decades. And industrial farming—especially of annual crops like vegetables and grains—are especially to blame, as farmers tend to over-apply fertilizers to boost their yields. As a result, much attention has been directed at reducing the amount of excess nitrogen added to agricultural soils via fertilizer.

Experts say the key to reducing agricultural emissions of nitrous oxide is using fertilizer more efficiently. This means figuring out the right amount to use and the right time to apply it. That’s more challenging than it sounds, because modern agriculture relies heavily on over-production, and the simplest way to guarantee high yields is to use more nutrients than necessary.

### Fluorinated Gases

Fluorinated gases are a family of man-made gases used in a range of industrial applications. They are powerful greenhouse gases, with a global warming effect up to 23,000 times greater than carbon dioxide, and their emissions are rising strongly. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are by far the most relevant F-gas group from a climate perspective, although they are relatively short-lived. The other two F-gas groups, perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), can remain in the atmosphere for thousands of years.

* Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are used in various sectors and applications, such as refrigerants in refrigeration, air-conditioning and heat pump equipment; as blowing agents for foams; as solvents; and in fire extinguishers and aerosols.

* Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are typically used in the electronics sector (for example for plasma cleaning of silicon wafers) as well as in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry. In the past PFCs were also used in fire extinguishers and can still be found in older fire protection systems.

* Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) is used mainly as an insulating gas, in high voltage switchgear and in the production of magnesium and aluminium.
