## Oceans

What is SDG #14 Life Under Water?

Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development

https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal14 

The UN has defined 10 targets and 10 indicators for SDG 14 that include preventing and reducing marine pollution and ocean acidification, protecting marine and coastal ecosystems, and regulating fishing. The targets also call for an increase in scientific knowledge of the oceans.

Target 14.1: Reduce marine pollution
Target 14.2: Protect and restore ecosystems
Target 14.3: Reduce ocean acidification
Target 14.4: Sustainable fishing
Target 14.5: Conserve coastal and marine areas
Target 14.6: End subsidies contributing to overfishing
Target 14.7: Increase the economic benefits from sustainable use of marine resources
Target 14.a: Increase scientific knowledge, research and technology for ocean health
Target 14.b: Support small scale fishers
Target 14.c: Implement and enforce international sea law


Too much nitrogen and phosphorus in the marine environment causes eutrophication with massive growth of nutrient-feeding algae which consume oxygen in the water column and, in extreme cases, create a dead water zone or hypoxia.

Do our oceans recognize political boundaries? Can they be analyzed at a country level?
