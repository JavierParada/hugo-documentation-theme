Most of the ocean (59%) is experiencing significantly increasing cumulative impact, in particular due to climate change but also from fishing, land-based pollution and shipping.

In the last 50 years, fishing has had the single greatest impact on sea life. We are overfishing a third of the world's fish stocks, and another 60 percent are fished at their maximum sustainable levels. Our development of coastlines, drilling of seabeds, and plastic pollution make the seas even more inhospitable to healthy marine life populations. And that familiar villain, carbon pollution, is acidifying and warming the oceans. Together, these threats imperil some of the very foundations of marine ecosystems: coral reefs and plankton.

## Oceans

What is SDG #14 Life Under Water?

Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development

https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal14 

The UN has defined 10 targets and 10 indicators for SDG 14 that include preventing and reducing marine pollution and ocean acidification, protecting marine and coastal ecosystems, and regulating fishing. The targets also call for an increase in scientific knowledge of the oceans.

Target 14.1: Reduce marine pollution
Target 14.2: Protect and restore ecosystems
Target 14.3: Reduce ocean acidification

The anthropogenic increase in atmospheric CO2 is not only considered to drive global warming, but also ocean acidification. 

Target 14.4: Sustainable fishing
Target 14.5: Conserve coastal and marine areas
Target 14.6: End subsidies contributing to overfishing
Target 14.7: Increase the economic benefits from sustainable use of marine resources
Target 14.a: Increase scientific knowledge, research and technology for ocean health
Target 14.b: Support small scale fishers
Target 14.c: Implement and enforce international sea law


Too much nitrogen and phosphorus in the marine environment causes eutrophication with massive growth of nutrient-feeding algae which consume oxygen in the water column and, in extreme cases, create a dead water zone or hypoxia.

## Index of coastal eutrophication 

The "Index of Coastal Eutrophication (ICEP), refers to the inputs of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and silica, in different forms) from rivers, and corresponding nutrient-ratio sub-indicator." The methodology for ICEP will be developed and ready by 2020. No data is available for this indicator yet.

## Floating plastic debris density

The "Floating Plastic Debris Density" refers to the modelled macro and micro plastics distribution in the ocean. If the quantities of floating micro is below 4.75mm, it is labeled as micro and if it is over 4.75 cm, it is labeled as macro. The amount of plastics in large marine ecosystems are measured based on "a model of surface water circulation and the use of proxy inputs". The final Floating Plastics Debris Density indicators will be ready by 2020.

Do our oceans recognize political boundaries? Can they be analyzed at a country level?

Marine Protected Areas

From the Florida Keys to Australia's Great Barrier Reef, pockets of oceans, bays, and estuaries around the world are designated as marine protected areas (MPAs).

The accelerating rate of creating marine protected areas (MPAs) to meet Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) targets of 10% of the ocean within protected area by 2020 (ref.14), and the push globally to create very large MPAs15, could similarly benefit from detailed maps of where and how fast cumulative impacts are changing, as this information is critical to siting and managing effective protected areas.

The Philippines, an Asian island nation making up approximately 1% of the world's population is responsible for a 36.4% of the world's ocean plastic.


Stressors. We include stressors from 4 primary categories:
* Fishing: commercial demersal destructive, commercial demersal nondestructive high bycatch, commercial demersal nondestructive low bycatch, pelagic high bycatch, pelagic low bycatch, artisanal
* Climate change: sea surface temperature, ocean acidification, sea level rise
* Ocean: shipping
* Land-based: nutrient pollution, organic chemical pollution, direct human, light
