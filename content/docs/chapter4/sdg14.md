Most of the ocean (59%) is experiencing significantly increasing cumulative impact, in particular due to climate change but also from fishing, land-based pollution and shipping.

In the last 50 years, fishing has had the single greatest impact on sea life. We are overfishing a third of the world's fish stocks, and another 60 percent are fished at their maximum sustainable levels. Our development of coastlines, drilling of seabeds, and plastic pollution make the seas even more inhospitable to healthy marine life populations. And that familiar villain, carbon pollution, is acidifying and warming the oceans. Together, these threats imperil some of the very foundations of marine ecosystems: coral reefs and plankton.

## Oceans

What is SDG #14 Life Under Water?

Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development

https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal14 

The UN has defined 10 targets and 10 indicators for SDG 14 that include preventing and reducing marine pollution and ocean acidification, protecting marine and coastal ecosystems, and regulating fishing. The targets also call for an increase in scientific knowledge of the oceans.

Target 14.1: Reduce marine pollution
Target 14.2: Protect and restore ecosystems
Target 14.3: Reduce ocean acidification

The anthropogenic increase in atmospheric CO2 is not only considered to drive global warming, but also ocean acidification. 

Target 14.4: Sustainable fishing
Target 14.5: Conserve coastal and marine areas
Target 14.6: End subsidies contributing to overfishing
Target 14.7: Increase the economic benefits from sustainable use of marine resources
Target 14.a: Increase scientific knowledge, research and technology for ocean health
Target 14.b: Support small scale fishers
Target 14.c: Implement and enforce international sea law

Do our oceans recognize political boundaries? Can they be analyzed at a country level?

Marine Protected Areas

From the Florida Keys to Australia's Great Barrier Reef, pockets of oceans, bays, and estuaries around the world are designated as marine protected areas (MPAs).

The accelerating rate of creating marine protected areas (MPAs) to meet Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) targets of 10% of the ocean within protected area by 2020 (ref.14), and the push globally to create very large MPAs15, could similarly benefit from detailed maps of where and how fast cumulative impacts are changing, as this information is critical to siting and managing effective protected areas.

The Philippines, an Asian island nation making up approximately 1% of the world's population is responsible for a 36.4% of the world's ocean plastic.


Stressors. We include stressors from 4 primary categories:
* Fishing: commercial demersal destructive, commercial demersal nondestructive high bycatch, commercial demersal nondestructive low bycatch, pelagic high bycatch, pelagic low bycatch, artisanal
* Climate change: sea surface temperature, ocean acidification, sea level rise
* Ocean: shipping
* Land-based: nutrient pollution, organic chemical pollution, direct human, light

Keywords:

** Eutrophication ** Excessive richness of nutrients in a body of water, frequently due to runoff from the land, which causes a dense growth of plant life and death of animal life from lack of oxygen. The most common nutrients causing eutrophication are nitrogen and phosphorus. The main source of nitrogen pollutants is run-off from agricultural land, whereas most phosphorus pollution comes from households and industry, including phosphorus-based detergents. Most of the commercially fixed nitrogen and mined phosphorus goes into production of fertilizer. The rising demand for fertilizer has come from the need to meet the nutritional demands of our rapidly expanding human population. The rise in intensive fertilizer use has serious implications for coastal habitats because greater application results in greater runoff, and the fraction of fertilizer lost from fields will increase with intensity of application. Nutrient removal in sewage treatment plants and promotion of phosphorus-free detergents are vital to minimize the impact of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in Europe's waters.

Too much nitrogen and phosphorus in the marine environment causes eutrophication with massive growth of nutrient-feeding algae which consume oxygen in the water column and, in extreme cases, create a dead water zone or hypoxia.

## Index of coastal eutrophication 

The "Index of Coastal Eutrophication (ICEP), refers to the inputs of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and silica, in different forms) from rivers, and corresponding nutrient-ratio sub-indicator." The methodology for ICEP will be developed and ready by 2020. No data is available for this indicator yet.

## Floating plastic debris density

The "Floating Plastic Debris Density" refers to the modelled macro and micro plastics distribution in the ocean. If the quantities of floating micro is below 4.75mm, it is labeled as micro and if it is over 4.75 cm, it is labeled as macro. The amount of plastics in large marine ecosystems are measured based on "a model of surface water circulation and the use of proxy inputs". The final Floating Plastics Debris Density indicators will be ready by 2020.



** Hypoxic dead zone ** Hypoxia occurs when dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration falls to or below 2 ml of O2/liter. When a body of water experiences hypoxic conditions, aquatic flora and fauna begin to change behavior in order to reach sections of water with higher oxygen levels. Once DO declines below 0.5 ml O2/liter in a body of water, mass mortality occurs. With such low concentration of DO, these bodies of water fail to support the aquatic life living there. Historically, many of these sites were naturally occurring. However, in the 1970s, oceanographers began noting increased instances and expanses of dead zones. These occur near inhabited coastlines, where aquatic life is most concentrated. The majority of the worldâ€™s dead zones are located along the eastern coast of the United States, and the coastlines of the Baltic States, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula.

Dead zones in the coastal oceans have spread exponentially since the 1960s and have serious consequences for ecosystem functioning. The formation of dead zones has been exacerbated by the increase in primary production and consequent worldwide coastal eutrophication fueled by riverine runoff of fertilizers and the burning of fossil fuels. Enhanced primary production results in an accumulation of particulate organic matter, which encourages microbial activity and the consumption of dissolved oxygen in bottom waters. Dead zones have now been reported from more than 400 systems, affecting a total area of more than 245,000 square kilometers, and are probably a key stressor on marine ecosystems.
