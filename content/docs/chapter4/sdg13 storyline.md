The world isn't cutting greenhouse gas emissions with anything like the speed required to avoid the most dangerous effects of climate change. 

The international goal to limit global heating to 1.5° Celsius is officially on life support. 

A United Nations-backed panel of climate scientists warned in a new report released Monday that the world may be on track to warm by more than 3°C — twice the Paris Agreement target —in a change that would painfully remake societies and life on the planet. 

# Historical emissions

Total net anthropogenic GHG emissions [FOOTNOTE 6] have continued to rise during the period 2010–2019, as have cumulative net CO2 emissions since 1850. Average annual GHG emissions during 2010-2019 were higher than in any previous decade, but the rate of growth between 2010 and 2019 was lower than that between 2000 and 2009.
