Interaction between goals 7 and 13:

- South Africa is set to receive $8.5bn to help end its reliance on coal and transition towards renewables in a deal announced at the COP26 climate summit.
- The country is currently a major emitter of greenhouse gases as a result of its addiction to coal, which it uses to generate electricity. Currently, 80% of its power comes from coal but what it generates is still not enough to satisfy demand.
- The vast scale of the coal operation run by the country's state power company Eskom makes South Africa the 12th biggest carbon dioxide emitter in the world and also the world's largest emitter of sulphur dioxide.
