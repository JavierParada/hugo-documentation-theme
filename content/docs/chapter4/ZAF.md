An example of an interaction between SDG's 7 and 13 for SDG Atlas 2022:

- South Africa is set to receive $8.5bn to help end its reliance on coal and transition towards renewables in a deal announced at the COP26 climate summit.
- The country is currently a major emitter of greenhouse gases as a result of its addiction to coal, which it uses to generate electricity. Currently, 80% of its power comes from coal but what it generates is still not enough to satisfy demand. 
- The vast scale of the coal operation run by the country's state power company Eskom makes South Africa the 15th largest carbon dioxide emitter in the world and also the world's largest emitter of sulphur dioxide.

## Energy mix

Coal remains a central part of the global energy mix, producing around 37% of the world’s electricity in 2019. More than 40 countries have agreed to phase out coal-fired power at the COP26 climate summit. The agreement includes 18 countries promising to phase out or stop investments in new coal-fired plants domestically and internationally for the first time.
Could countries substantially lower their electricity sector’s carbon emissions by targeting extreme polluters located within their borders? 

## Super polluters approach

The current focus of blaming individuals (e.g., Trump, the Koch Brothers), political parties (e.g., Republicans), or demographic groups (e.g., baby boomers) as the culprits is to lose sight of the power plants that connect them to the points where energy is actually produced and the largest quantities of carbon are released. In the absence of an international cap-and-trade system, the next best strategy is to set targets for electricity sectors’ carbon intensities, measures by the amount of CO2 emitted per megawatt (MW) of electricity production and identify super polluters.

Secunda power station is an 880-megawatt power plant in Mpumalanga, South Africa. With annual emissions of 56.5 million tons of greenhouse gases, Secunda has been identified by South African and international groups as the world’s biggest single-site emitter.
