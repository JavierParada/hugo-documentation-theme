## What will it take to end deforestation by 2030?

In a new pledge made at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, 141 countries signed the [Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use](https://ukcop26.org/glasgow-leaders-declaration-on-forests-and-land-use/):

*We therefore commit to working collectively to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030 while delivering sustainable development and promoting an inclusive rural transformation.* 

There remains ambiguity about whether the pledge means “zero” deforestation or “net zero” deforestation. Zero deforestation would mean no loss of old growth forests anywhere. But net zero deforestation means old growth forests could still be cleared, so long as new forests were planted at the same rate. 

An analysis by the World Resources Institute (WRI) found that ending forest loss by 2030 in all signatory countries of the pledge would avoid 33 million hectares of forest loss, an area roughly the size of Malaysia. It would also avoid emissions of 19 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e), around twice the annual emissions of China.
