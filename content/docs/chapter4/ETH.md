## A rural challenge for Africa's second most populated country

With about 115 million people (2020), Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria. According to the latest indicator on access to electricity for 2020, 51.1% of Ethiopia has access to electricity. This means 56.2 million people still lack access to electricity. This chapter provides a path towards universal access to electricity in Ethiopia by 2030. 

The country covers 1,112,000 square kilometres (472,000 sq. miles) making it roughly as large as France and Spain combined and five times the size of the UK. Approximately 78% percent of the population live in rural areas in 2020.

## New advances in nighttime lights

Nighttime lights are heavily concentrated in Addis Ababa. Other than a little more brightness in Addis Ababa, the comparison between 2012 and 2016 shows very little change and a stark contrast with Saudi Arabia's coast.

## How do we measure access to electricity 

Access to reliable, affordable and modern energy services is fundamental to sustainable development as codified in the SDG 7.1.  Achieving this will require substantial new investment, deployment of innovative technologies, and a wide range of interventions targeted for underserved populations. The success of such interventions largely depends on data and analytics availability of existing access gaps, and potential options to overcome them. 

Acess to electricity is measured as having a connection. Based on survey data from LSMS such as the question below taken from the 2011/12 Ethiopian Rural Socioeconomic Survey.

## MTF

The Multi-Tier Framework (MTF) initiative redefines the way energy access is measured, going beyond the traditional binary measure of "connected or not connected" for electricity access. In The MTF, electricity access is measured based on the combination of seven attributes of energy across six tiers of access with minimum requirements by tier of electricity access.

The MTF starts with the lowest level of access (Tier 1), referring to limited access to small quantities of electricity for a few hours per day, enabling the household to use electric lighting and phone charging.  This level of access can be provided by any technology, even a small solar lighting system.  Higher tiers of access are defined by higher capacity and longer duration of supply, enabling the use of medium and high load appliances (such as refrigerator, washing machine and air conditioning).

### Diagnostic

Almost all households in Addis Ababa (99.9%) are connected to the grid. Therefore, electricity access in Ethiopia is primarily a rural challenge.

## Current energy mix

Approximately 90% of the installed generation capacity is from hydropower, while the remaining 8% and 2% is from wind and thermal sources, respectively. The hydro dominated systems have been severely affected by drought, and the Government of Ethiopia is now diversifying the generation mix with other sources such as solar, wind, and geothermal that will result in a more climate-resilient power system. 

## Power Plants

Ethiopia is actively exploiting its water resources by building dams, reservoirs, irrigation and diversion canals and hydropower stations.

The Gibe III hydroelectric project is so far the largest in the country with an installed capacity of 1870 MW. For the year 2017-18 (2010 E.C) this hydroelectric dam generated 4,900 GWh.

Ethiopia is building the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) which has the capacity of producing 45,000 MW of electric power.  With a planned installed capacity of 5.15 gigawatts, the dam will be the largest hydroelectric power plant in Africa when completed, as well as the seventh largest in the world.

## Solar Power

Given the low electricity consumption and uptake of appliances among rural households,
off-grid solar solutions should be prioritized as an immediate solution for unelectrified
rural households that are not covered by the densification program in the short term.

Remote sensing techniques and geographic information systems have revolutionized data collection by providing a range of location-specific information that was not previously accessible.

## Conclusion

Despite the impressive grid expansion in Ethiopia to date, the percentage of electrified households remains low at only about 33%. The Government’s recently launched National Electrification Program envisions that by 2025, 65% of the population will be connected to the grid as they place a strong emphasis on scaling up connections in areas within short-term reach of the grid.

The other 35% – or around 7.7 million households – will need an interim off-grid solution while waiting for grid expansion, or even a permanent one where appropriate, such as in very remote areas where grid access will remain too costly and logistically challenging even in the long term.
