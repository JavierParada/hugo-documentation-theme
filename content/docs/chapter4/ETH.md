With about 115 million people (2020), Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria. According to the latest indicator on access to electricity for 2020, 51.1% of Ethiopia has access to electricity. This means 56.2 million people still lack access to electricity. This chapter provides a path towards universal access to electricity in Ethiopia by 2030. 

## New advances in nighttime lights

The country covers 1,112,000 square kilometres (472,000 sq. miles) making it roughly as large as France and Spain combined and five times the size of the UK. Approximately 85 percent of the population live in rural areas.

This comparison between 2012 and 2016 shows nighttime lights are concentrated in Addis Ababa. Other than a little more brightness in Addis Ababa, there is very little change between 2012 and 2016. Stark contrast with Saudi Arabia's coast.

## Power Plants

The Gibe III hydroelectric project is so far the largest in the country with an installed capacity of 1870 MW. For the year 2017-18 (2010 E.C) this hydroelectric dam generated 4,900 GWh.

Ethiopia is building the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) which has the capacity of producing 45,000 MW of electric power. The Dam has the potential of lifting millions of Ethiopians out of poverty and raising the standard of living. It will further connect Ethiopia with its neighbors laying the ground for regional economic integration. (Updated December 2020)


## Solar Power

Remote sensing techniques and geographic information systems have revolutionized data collection by providing a range of location-specific information that was not previously accessible.
