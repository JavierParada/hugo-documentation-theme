## A rural challenge for Africa's second most populated country

According to the latest indicator on access to electricity for 2020, 51.1% of Ethiopia has access to electricity. This means 56.2 million people (115,000,000 * (100-51.1)/100) still lack access to electricity. SDG7 aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all by 2030 by ensuring universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services, and substantially increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. This chapter provides a path towards universal access to electricity in Ethiopia by 2030. 

With about 115 million people (2020), Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria. Ethiopia's urban population is concentrated in the capital city, Addis Ababa. Outside of Addis Ababa, the vast majority of Ethiopian population still lives in rural settlements consisting of hamlets and villages (approximately 78% percent of the population lived in rural areas in 2020). The country covers 1,104,300 square kilometers (426,400 square miles) making it roughly as large as France and Spain combined and five times the size of the UK. However, the distribution of population in Ethiopia is very uneven because lowlands are characterized by scarcity of rainfall, high temperature, and poor vegetation and soil conditions.

## Nighttime Lights 

The availability of granular remotely sensed nighttime light observations opens the door to new possibilities to track access to sustainable and reliable energy. 

In Ethiopia, nighttime lights are heavily concentrated in Addis Ababa. Other than a little more brightness in Addis Ababa, the comparison between 2012 and 2016 shows very little change and a stark contrast with Saudi Arabia's coast in the Red Sea.

## How do we measure access to electricity 

Access to reliable, affordable, and modern energy services is fundamental to sustainable development as codified in the SDG 7.1. Achieving this will require substantial new investment, deployment of innovative technologies, and a wide range of interventions targeted for underserved populations. The success of such interventions largely depends on data and analytics availability of existing access gaps, and potential options to overcome them. 

Access to electricity is measured as having a connection or not based on survey data from LSMS such as the question below taken from the Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey (ESS) 2018/19:

<img src="/ETH/Question.png" alt="demo" class="img-responsive" title="Questionnaire">

The Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey (ESS) 2018/19 was able to show how sources of electricity vary between urban and rural areas. In urban areas, about 87 percent of households reported using electricity as their primary source of lighting, compared to 9.1 percent in rural areas. In rural areas, solar energy, dry cell batteries, kerosene lamps, and firewood together comprise 90 percent of light sources.

| Main source of light       | National | Rural | Urban |
| -------------------------- | -------- | ----- | ----- |
| Private electric meter     | 13.9     | 2.2   | 38.3  |
| Shared electric meter      | 20.3     | 6.9   | 48.2  |
| Solar                      | 21.5     | 30.2  | 3.5   |
| Dry cell light with switch | 13.5     | 18.8  | 2.5   |
| Kerosene lamp              | 19.2     | 26.8  | 3.5   |
| Firewood                   | 10.4     | 14    | 3     |
| Other                      | 1.1      | 1.1   | 1.1   |
|                            | 99.9     | 100   | 100.1 |

The Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey (ESS) 2018/19 also asked households with electricity about their monthly payments: nationally, about 79 percent pay less than 100 Birr (less than US$3) per month. Households were also asked about any outages in electricity in the 7 days before the survey. About 98 percent reported at least one disruption, with disruptions about equal in rural and urban areas.

The World Bank's Global Electrification Database compiles nationally representative household survey data (such as the Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey (ESS) 2018/19 and other LSMS, MTF, DHS, and census data). This collection of approximately 1,282 surveys from 139 countries allows the calculation of regional and global electricity access rates:

According to these electricity access rates, the number of people lacking access to electricity worldwide has decreased to 732 million driven mostly by South Asia. Sub-Saharan Africa has seen an increase. In 2020, 4 out of 5 people who lack access to electricity live in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Substantial progress has been made toward developing and piloting a new methodology known as the Multi-Tier Framework for Measuring Energy Access which can capture the broader
dimensions of service quality and goes beyond a simple yes/no measure of energy access to a more refined approach that recognizes different levels of energy access.

## The Multi-Tier Framework (MTF)

The Multi-Tier Framework (MTF) initiative redefines the way energy access is measured, going beyond the traditional binary measure of "connected or not connected" for electricity access. In the MTF, electricity access is measured based on the combination of seven attributes of energy across six tiers of access with minimum requirements by tier of electricity access.

The MTF starts with the lowest level of access (Tier 1), referring to limited access to small quantities of electricity for a few hours per day, enabling the household to use electric lighting and phone charging.  This level of access can be provided by any technology, even a small solar lighting system.  Higher tiers of access are defined by higher capacity and longer duration of supply, enabling the use of medium and high load appliances (such as refrigerator, washing machine and air conditioning).

<img src="/ETH/access_to_electricity.jpeg" alt="demo" class="img-responsive" title="Multi-Tier Framework for Measuring Access to Electricity">

Seven attributes:

- Capacity: What appliances can I power?
- Availability: Is power available when I need it?
- Reliability: Is my service frequently interrupted?
- Quality: Will voltage fluctuations damage my appliances?
- Affordability: Can I afford to purchase the minimum amount of electricity?
- Formality: Is the service provided formally or by informal connections?
- Health and Safety: Is it safe to use my electricity service or do I risk injuries from using this service?

## MTF Diagnostic in Ethiopia

The MTF so far has been published for in 13 countries (7 countries published early next FY: MDG, UGA, COD, SLE, ZWE, PNG, and BFA). The results of conducting the MTF in Ethiopia indicate that: 

- 57% of households have access to at least one source of electricity: 33.1% of households have access through the grid, and 23.9% have access through off-grid solutions.
- Of these 57% of households, only 77.7% (or 44.3% of all Ethiopian households) have access to at least basic electricity supply. 
- The remaining 55.7% have no access to any electricity source, rely on dry-cell batteries, or have a grid or off-grid electricity supply that does not provide basic energy service (ability to light the house and charge phones and available for at least 4 hours a day, including 1 hour in the evening)
- Almost all households in Addis Ababa (99.9%) are connected to the grid. Therefore, electricity access in Ethiopia is primarily a rural challenge.

## Current energy mix

Ethiopia is actively exploiting its water resources by building dams, reservoirs, irrigation and diversion canals and hydropower stations.  Approximately 90% of the installed generation capacity is from hydropower, while the remaining 8% and 2% is from wind and thermal sources, respectively. The hydro dominated systems have been severely affected by drought, and the Government of Ethiopia is now diversifying the generation mix with other sources such as solar, wind, and geothermal that will result in a more climate-resilient power system.

Ethiopia is building the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) which has the capacity of producing 45,000 MW of electric power.  With a planned installed capacity of 5.15 gigawatts, the dam will be the largest hydroelectric power plant in Africa when completed, as well as the seventh largest in the world.

## Solar power potential

The Global Solar Atlas provides quick and easy access to solar resource and photovoltaic power potential data globally. The North and Northeast regions of Ethiopia have the highest potential for solar.

Given the low electricity consumption and uptake of appliances among rural households in Ethiopia,
off-grid solar solutions should be prioritized as an immediate solution for unelectrified
rural households that are not covered by the densification program in the short term. 

The Global Electrification Platform (GEP) shows the settlements where electricity could be provided by expanding the current national grid. For the rest of the settlements, a stand-alone PV system is suggested as the best alternative to gain access to electricity for settlements that are far away from the existing grid. A simple stand-alone PV system is an automatic solar system that produces electrical power to charge banks of batteries during the day for use at night when the suns energy is unavailable.

## Conclusion

Despite the grid expansion in Ethiopia to date, access to electricity (% of population) remains low at only about 51.1% in 2020. The rate among the rural population is lower at 39.4% This means 56.22 million people in Ethiopia must be provided an electricity source to achieve universal access by 2030. 

The Multi-Tier Framework's measurement of 44.3% indicating access to tiers 1-5 was even lower. 

The Government's recently launched National Electrification Program envisions that by 2025, 65% of the population will be connected to the grid as they place a strong emphasis on scaling up connections in areas within short-term reach of the grid. The other 35% will need an interim off-grid solution while waiting for grid expansion.
