This paper measures the risk from sea level rise at the global level. It identifies low-elevation coastal zones in every country and measures the population living in these areas.  

Our goal is to measure two indicators that have been discontinued in the World Development Indicators: 
* `AG.LND.EL5M.ZS` Land area where elevation is below 5 meters (% of total land area) 
* `EN.POP.EL5M.ZS` Population living in areas where elevation is below 5 meters (% of total population) 

A threshold of 5 meters from sea level is used as the standard, but alternate thresholds are evaluated.  

The obtained results may be previewed in the scatter plot below:
