## Measuring risk from sea level rise

This analysis is divided into the following sections:

* **Introduction to EL5M Analysis**
* **Motivation**
* **Methodology**
* **Results**
* **Analysis for urban areas**
* **References**


## Objective

Sea levels around the globe are increasing as ocean temperature warms and causes water to expand in volume, along with land-based ice melting and increasing the amount of water in the ocean. Rising sea levels not only make coastal living more dangerous from storm flooding and erosion, but also cause significant habitat loss and impacts to ecosystems.

Heating of the climate system has caused global mean sea level rise through ice loss on land and thermal expansion from ocean warming. Global mean sea level increased by 0.20 meters between 1901 and 2018 and will continue to rise over the 21st century. Thermal expansion explained 50% of sea level rise during 1971-2018, while ice loss from glaciers contributed 22%, ice sheets 20% and changes in land water storage 8%. 

Human activities affect all the major climate system components, with some responding over decades and others over centuries

The objective of this analysis is to create indicators of risk from sea level rise for the whole world. The current indicators available in the World Development Indicators are:

| Indicator                                                                                                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Rural land area where elevation is below 5 meters (sq. km)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.EL5M.RU.K2)                                 |
| [Urban land area where elevation is below 5 meters (sq. km)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.EL5M.UR.K2)                                 |
| [Land area where elevation is below 5 meters (% of total land area)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.EL5M.ZS)                            |
| [Rural land area where elevation is below 5 meters (% of total land area)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.EL5M.RU.ZS)                   |
| [Urban land area where elevation is below 5 meters (% of total land area)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.EL5M.UR.ZS)                   |
| [Population living in areas where elevation is below 5 meters (% of total population)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.POP.EL5M.ZS)          |
| [Rural population living in areas where elevation is below 5 meters (% of total population)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.POP.EL5M.RU.ZS) |
| [Urban population living in areas where elevation is below 5 meters (% of total population)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.POP.EL5M.UR.ZS) |

These eight indicators have recently been updated for 2015 using the Low Elevation Coastal Zone (LECZ) Urban-Rural Population and Land Area Estimates, Version 3 data set published by [CIESIN](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/lecz-urban-rural-population-land-area-estimates-v3). This study provides estimates of urban and rural populations and land areas for the years 1990, 2000, 2015 for 234 countries and statistical areas with contiguous coastal elevations of less than or equal to 5m above sea level, 5-10m above sea level, and national totals using multiple updated data sources for comparative analysis.
