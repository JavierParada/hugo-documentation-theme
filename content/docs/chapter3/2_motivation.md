The amount of greenhouse gas emissions in coming decades will be consequential for global mean sea level rise through a combination of ocean thermal expansion and loss of land ice. The three main reasons global warming causes sea level to rise are:  

* **Ocean thermal expansion (hot water, which is less dense than cold water, takes up more space)**
* **Rapid loss of land ice (ice sheets lose ice faster than it forms from snowfall)**
* **Rapid melting of glaciers at the poles**

Sea level is rising at an accelerating rate due to global warming. Global mean sea level (GMSL) rose 11-16 cm in the twentieth century. Under higher emissions scenarios, twenty-first century rise may approach or exceed 2 meters in the case of early-onset Antarctic ice sheet instability (Kulp and Strauss, 2019).  

Sea level rise since the start of the 20th century has been dominated by retreat of glaciers and expansion of the ocean, but the contributions of the two large ice sheets are expected to increase in the 21st century. Two major ice sheets exist today, in Greenland and Antarctica. Greenland's ice sheet is about three times the size of Texas, and Antarctica's could cover the surface area of the United States and Mexico combined.  

The Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica is likely to collapse within a decade from 2021, leading to increased outflow and contribution to sea-level rise. The glacier is the size of Florida or Britain and currently contributes four percent of annual global sea level rise. If it does collapse, global sea levels would rise by several feet putting millions of people living in coastal cities in danger zones for extreme flooding. 

In 2019, a study projected that in a low emission scenario, sea level will rise 30 centimeters by 2050 and 69 centimeters by 2100, relative to the level in 2000. In a high emission scenario, it will be 34 cm by 2050 and 111 cm by 2100. There is the probability that the rise will be beyond 2 meters by 2100 in the high emission scenario, which will cause displacement of 187 million people. 


# Most vulnerable areas

Less developed countries are generally more affected than industrialized countries. Kulp and Strauss (2019) find that more than 70% of the total number of people worldwide currently living on implicated land are in eight Asian countries: China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Japan.  Asia-Pacific is the most disaster-prone region in the world and with extensive coastlines, low-lying territories, and many small island states, its geography makes it highly susceptible to rising sea levels and weather extremes.  

Climate change threatens people around the world but particularly in locations where concentrations of people can be expected to overlap with concentrations of physical hazards resulting from climate change. As shown by MacManus et al. (2021), low-elevation coastal zones (LECZs) are likely to contain a disproportionate and growing share of such locations:

- In Bangladesh, around 18 million people living in coastal areas will lose their homes if the sea level rises by one meter.
- Indonesia is already planning to move its heavily populated capital Jakarta, to Borneo to protect its residents from dangerous flooding. 
- Parts of Ho Chi Minh City and Bangkok could be underwater by 2050. Millions of people in Vietnam's Mekong Delta could be forced to flee coastal areas. 
- Cities on China's eastern coast have already been making contingency plans to cope with rising sea levels, with the major financial hub of Shanghai already looking into building new drainage tunnels and tidal gates. 
- In India, Mumbai is an example of a colonial port city that once flourished because of its proximity to water, but is now at risk.  
- Africa's most populous city, Lagos, is battling floods and rising seas.  

These issues are not exclusive to lower- and middle-income countries: 
- In the United States, coastal states with large areas of low-lying land, including Louisiana, Florida, North Carolina, California, and South Carolina, are particularly vulnerable to rising seas and coastal storm surges. 
- About one-third of the Netherlands is below sea level and two-thirds is vulnerable to flooding.  
- The UK is expected to be one of the countries most greatly affected by the world's changing sea levels. In London, rising sea levels could cause the Thames to flood and submerge vast areas of the capital in water.
